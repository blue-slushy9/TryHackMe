# APACHE LOG ENTRY
158.32.51.188 - - [25/Oct/2023:09:11:14 +0000] "GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.1" 200
11173 "-" "curl/7.68.0"

158.32.51.188 = source IP for the request

- - = placeholders for username and authenticated user, which stay empty in
      anonymouse requests

+0000 = timezone offset from UTC time, i.e. it was recorded in UTC; e.g. +0530
would mean event occurred 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC

"GET = HTTP method

/robots.txt = resource path

HTTP/1.1" = protocol and version thereof

200 = status code returned by server, in this case "successful request"

11173 = size of response sent by server in bytes

"-" = placeholder for the referrer header, which indicates the previous page
visited by the client

"curl/7.68.0" = user agent string, identifies software used by the client to

# PROXY SERVER
Intermediary between your computer/device and the internet. When you request
information or access to a webpage, your device connects to the proxy server
instead of directly to the target server. The proxy server then forwards your
request to the internet, receives the response, and then relays it back to
your device.

A proxy server offers visibility into network traffic and user activities,
since it logs all web requests and responses. This allows sysadmins and
security analysts to monitor which websites users access, when, and how much
bandwidth is used; also to enforce policies and block specific websites or
content.

# FILEPATH OF PROXY LOG
/home/ubuntu/Desktop/artefacts/access.log

# BASH COMMANDS

    # VIEW CONTENTS OF FILE ONE PAGE AT A TIME
    less <filepath>

    # VIEW CONTENTS AT TOP OF FILE
    head <filepath>

        # DISPLAY N NUMBER OF LINES ONLY, e.g. 10
        head -n 10 <filepath> # The -n switch also works in 'tail'

    # VIEW CONTENTS AT END OF FILE
    tail <filepath>

    # COUNT LINES, WORDS, AND CHARACTERS IN A TEXT FILE
    wc <filepath>

        # DISPLAY LINE COUNT ONLY
        wc -l <filepath>

    # RENDERS CONTENTS OF FILE IN A NUMBERED LINE FORMAT
    nl <filepath>

    # EXTRACT SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF LINES FROM FILES, ETC. BASED ON A DELIMITER
    cut -d ' ' -f1 access.log 

        # -d denotes delimiter, in this case a space
        # -f the position, in this case the first column in access.log

    # EXTRACT MULTIPLE COLUMNS
    cut -d ' ' -f1,3,6 access.log

        # Extracts columns 1, 3, and 6

    # EXTRACT BASED ON A DIFFERENT DELIMITER, " instead of a space
    cut -d '"' -f2 access.log

    # SORT THE LINES OF TEXT FILES IN ASCENDING OR DESCENDING ORDER
    sort 

    # FILTER OUT AND DISPLAY UNIQUE LINES FROM A SORTED FILE
    uniq

# BASH PIPES

    # FUNNEL THE OUTPUT OF GREP INTO HEAD WITH ONLY THE FIRST FIVE RESULTS
    grep 10.10.10.10 access.log | head -n 5

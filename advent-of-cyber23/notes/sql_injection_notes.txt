# SQL
Essential for working with relational databases and building dynamic websites.
Used for checking bank account balance, browsing products on e-commerce sites,
posting on social media---all of these activities indirectly query and alter
databases. 

Relational databases are structured data collections organized into tables,
each consisting of various rows and columns. Within these collections, tables
are interconnected with predefined relationships, facilitating efficient data
organization retrieval. For example, an e-commerce relational database might
include tables for "customers", "orders", and "products" with relationships
defined to link customer information to their respective orders through the
use of identifiers.

SQL provides a rigid way to query, insert, update, and delete the data stored
in these tables, allowing you to retrieve and alter databases as needed. A
website or application that relies on a database must dynamically generate SQL
queries and send them to the database engine to fetch or update the necessary
data. The syntax of SQL queries is based on English and consists of structured
commands using keywords like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN to express
operations in a natural, language-like way.

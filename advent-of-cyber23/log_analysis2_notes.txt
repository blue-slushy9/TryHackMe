# PROXY SERVER
Intermediary between your computer/device and the internet. When you request
information or access to a webpage, your device connects to the proxy server
instead of directly to the target server. The proxy server then forwards your
request to the internet, receives the response, and then relays it back to
your device.

A proxy server offers visibility into network traffic and user activities,
since it logs all web requests and responses. This allows sysadmins and
security analysts to monitor which websites users access, when, and how much
bandwidth is used; also to enforce policies and block specific websites or
content.
